<li>This paper describes the Kratos Framework, a novel GPU-based simulation system tailored for astrophysical simulations on heterogeneous devices. Kratos is designed to harness modern GPUs, providing a flexible and efficient platform for simulating a broad spectrum of astrophysical phenomena. It fundamental infrastructures relies on abstraction layers for devices, a multiprocessing communication model, and a mesh management system. These buildingblocks are designed for heterogeneous computing environments (especially GPUs) consistently, preparing for the supports for various physical modules, including hydrodynamics (which is elaborated in this paper), and thermochemistry, magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, and radiative processes in forthcoming papers.</li>
<li>Kratos is constructed for the CUDA, HIP and similar GPU programming models, employing abstraction layers to insulate algorithms from programming model disparities</li>

<li>The hydrodynamics module of Kratos is constructed within the Godunov framework, and the default implementation of sub-modules are slope-limited Piecewise Linear Method (PLM) reconstruction, HLLC Riemann solver, and Heun time integrator. Optimizations for heterogeneous devices include variable conversion, boundary conditions, flux calculation, and time integration. Verification and performance tests include Sod shock tubes, double Mach reflection test, Liska-Wendroff implosion, Kelvin-Helmhotz instabilities, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, and colliding stellar outflows and ambients. These tests validate algorithms, robustness, and performance of Kratos with results aligning with analytic solutions and demonstrating the effectiveness of the hydrodynamics module under various conditions.</li>

<li>Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) have a large diversity in their photometric and spectroscopic appearances, which reflects the diversity in the progenitor’s evolution and mass loss. The spectroscopic signature divides core-collapse SNe into two main types: Type II SNe from stars having hydrogen-rich envelopes, and Type Ibc SNe from stars that lost their hydrogen-rich envelope well before core-collapse. The leading channel for Type Ibc SNe is massive stars whose hydrogen-rich envelopes had been stripped off by binary interaction, typically with a main-sequence companion.</li>

<li>They further carried out a Monte-Carlo analysis to estimate the fraction of main-sequence disruptions following a SN event, finding that the fraction is sensitive to the orbital parameters like binary separation and companion mass. </li>

<li>This paper presents 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical for astrophysical blackhole jet-wind boundaries. The conditions only allow the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and DriftKink (DK) instabilities to develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. They find that DKI can effectively disrupt the cat’s-eye vortices generated by KHI, creating a turbulent shear layer on the DK timescale. This interplay leads to a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. This study highlights the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple simultaneous instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.</li>

<li>Theoretically predicted yields of elements created by the r-process carry potentially large uncertainties associated with incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties and approximative hydrodynamical modeling of the matter ejection processes.</li>
<li>Aims. They investigate both the model (systematic) and parameter (statistical) uncertainties affecting nuclear mass predictions and explore their impact on the r-process production, and subsequently on the composition of neutron star merger ejecta.<br>Methods. The impact of correlated model uncertainties on masses is estimated by considering five different nuclear mass models that are known to provide an accurate description of known masses. In addition, the uncorrelated uncertainties associated with local variation of model parameters are estimated using a variant of the backward-forward Monte Carlo method to constrain the parameter changes to experimentally known masses before propagating them consistently to the unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei. The impact of nuclear mass uncertainties is propagated to the r-process nucleosynthesis in a 1.38-1.38 $\mathbf{M}_{\odot}$ neutron star merger model considering a large and representative number of trajectories.<br>Results. The uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to the ejected abundances uncertainties of $20 \%$ up to $A \simeq 130$, $40 \%$ between $A=150$ and 200, and peaks around $A \simeq 140$ and $A \simeq 203$ giving rise to deviations around 100 to $300 \%$. The correlated model uncertainties remain larger than the parameter ones for most nuclei. However, both model and parameter uncertainties have an important impact on the heavy nuclei production.<br>Conclusions. Improvements to nuclear models are still crucial in reducing uncertainties in predictions related to the r-process nucleosynthesis. Both correlated model uncertainties and determining coherently parameter uncertainties are key in the sensitivity analysis.</li>

<li>Evolving the angular moments of particle distributions is a time-tested approach for solving the equations of radiation hydrodynamics. A common method for solving the moment evolution equations is to discretize the moments in space/time/momentum and use a Riemann solver for the Riemann problem across the cell boundaries. Generalizing a Riemann solver for the transport of quantum moments - a necessity to deal with flavor transformation phenomena - is not a straightforward endeavor. They have identified two crucial issues that a Riemann solver needs to address: how to indicate the direction of flow of the flavor space coherence of the flux, and how to reconstruct the off-diagonal elements of the moments at the cell interfaces. Their solution for the first issue is to use a signed modulus to describe the flux moment, and to address the second issue, we designed a new reconstruction algorithm in the spirit of the well-known “minmod” limiter generalized to the complex plane.</li>
<li>In all cases, the modulus phase implementation produces results that are closer to those of the particle-in-cell method.</li>

<li>In this paper, they employ the numerical methods to conduct the first parameter study of GRB jets propagating through realistic BNS merger environments. Specifically, the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations of magnetized incipient GRB jets, manually injected with different luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, into a realistic magnetized environment resulting from a 3D GRMHD BNS merger simulation. They particularly focus on the impact of such parameters on the jet’s dynamics, energetics, and final angular structure, providing quantitative details and comparison with state-of-the-art models in which instead simplified environments are adopted. In addition, the simulations extend up to 3 s after launch, significantly longer than the previous 3D RMHD simulations of GRB jets in BNS merger environments.</li>

<li>Black hole binary systems embedded in AGN discs have been proposed as a source of the observed gravitational waves (GWs) from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Studies have indicated binary-single encounters could be common place within this population, yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of how the ambient gas affects the dynamics of these three-body encounters. Using Athena++, they present the first hydrodynamical simulations of black hole binary-single encounters in an AGN disc. They find the gas is a non-negligible component of binary-single interactions, leading to unique dynamics, including the formation of quasi-stable hierarchical triples. The gas efficiently and reliably dissipates the energy of the three-body system, hardening the triple provided it remains bound after the initial encounter. The hardening timescale is shorter for higher ambient gas densities. Formed triple systems can be hardened reliably by $2-3$ orders of magnitude relative to the initial binary semi-major axis within less than a few AGN orbits, limited only by resolution. Their results suggest that current timescale estimates (without gas drag) for binary-single induced mergers are an upper bound. The shrinkage of the triple by gas has the prospect of increasing the chance for unique GW phenomena such as residual eccentricity, dephasing from a third object and double GW mergers.</li>

<li>The interstellar medium (ISM) of disk galaxies is turbulent, and yet the fundamental nature of ISM turbulence, the energy cascade, is not understood in detail. In this study, they use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical, gravitationally stratified, supernova ( SNe )-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the nature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of kinetic energy flux transfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\boldsymbol{u}_c$ and incompressible $\boldsymbol{u}_s$ modes, they show that there exists a large-to-small-scale cascade in both $\boldsymbol{u}_c$ and $\boldsymbol{u}_s$ when mediated by an additional $\boldsymbol{u}_s$ mode. But the $\boldsymbol{u}_s$ cascade is highly non-local. Moreover, there is a $\boldsymbol{u}_c$ mediated component of the $\boldsymbol{u}_s$ cascade that proceeds in the opposite direction - an inverse cascade from small-to-large scales. The cascade feeds flux into scales well beyond the gaseous scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct cascades. </li>

<li>They present a robust and efficient methodology for parameter estimation of gravitational waves generated during the post-merger phase of binary neutron star mergers. Their approach leverages an analytic waveform model combined with empirical relations to predict prior ranges for the postmerger frequencies based on measurements of the chirp mass and effective tidal deformability in the inspiral phase. This enables robust inference of the main features of the post-merger spectrum, avoiding possible multi-modality induced by wide priors. Using waveforms derived from numerical relativity, they systematically validate our model across a broad spectrum of neutron star equations of state and mass configurations, demonstrating high fitting factors. This method can be applied in future detections of gravitational waves from the post-merger phase with third-generation gravitational wave observatories. Furthermore, by integrating the Preconditioned Monte Carlo sampling method within the pocoMC framework, they achieve substantial computational acceleration compared to conventional Bayesian techniques.</li>

<li>This work presents a study of the late-time interaction between supermassive black hole binaries and retrograde circumbinary disks during the period of gravitational wave-driven inspiral. While mergers in prograde disks have received extensive study, retrograde disks offer distinct dynamics that could promote mergers and produce unique observational signatures. </li>
<li>They have performed numerical hydrodynamic simulations of retrograde circumbinary disks, hosting an equalmass binary undergoing gravitational wave inspiral. They have compared our results directly with prograde counterparts, to better understand the differences between prograde and retrograde disk configurations. </li>

<li>Numerical relativity (NR) faces significant challenges in generating GW catalogs at the required scale and accuracy on modern computers, as NR codes do not fully exploit modern GPU capabilities. In response, they extend NRPy, a Python-based NR code-generation framework, to develop NRPyEllipticGPU-a CUDA-optimized elliptic solver tailored for the binary black hole (BBH) initial data problem. NRPyEllipticGPU is the first GPU-enabled elliptic solver in the NR community, supporting a variety of coordinate systems and demonstrating substantial performance improvements on both consumer-grade and HPC-grade GPUs. They show that, when compared to a high-end CPU, NRPyEllipticGPU achieves on a highend GPU up to a sixteenfold speedup in single precision while increasing doubleprecision performance by a factor of $2-4$. This performance boost leverages the GPU’s superior parallelism and memory bandwidth to achieve a compute-bound application and enhancing the overall simulation efficiency. As NRPyEllipticGPU shares the core infrastructure common to NR codes, this work serves as a practical guide for developing full, CUDA-optimized NR codes.</li>
<li>BBH systems form the foundation of compact binary GW data analysis. Simulating such a system involves two basic steps: first, solving a set of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) to compute the initial data solution; and second, evolving this data forward in time by solving a system of hyperbolic PDEs (see e.g., [11, 12] for comprehensive reviews). Both calculations are computationally intensive, with the computational cost increasing for higher binary mass ratio and the component spins of the BHs.</li>
<li>In an effort to effectively leverage the latest HPC resources, the NR community continues to develop GPU-accelerated applications, with a primary focus on the time evolution of dynamical spacetimes. For general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of isolated objects, known frameworks include AsterX [19] and GRaM-X [20], both of which use the new Einstein Toolkit [21] driver CarpetX, built on the AMReX [22] programming framework. In contrast, Kokkos has been employed to rewrite Athena++ into more portable implementations, including the multi-physics framework Parthenon [23, 24], as well as AthenaK, which supports simulations of BBHs [25] and GRMHD studies of binary and isolated neutron stars [26]. In addition, NR frameworks natively ported using CUDA include SpEC [27], optimized for simulating isolated BHs, and Dendro-GR [28], designed for BBH simulations.</li>

<li>In this paper, they conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. They complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Their result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. </li>
<li>They employ a neutrino transport code by a finite volume approach with seventh-ordered weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, while the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for time integration. Such high-order numerical schemes are necessary to accurately capture the interplay between collective neutrino oscillations with neutrino advection. </li>
<li>They find that the growth rate of flavor conversion is underestimated, if the maximum growth mode is not properly captured. In these low resolution simulations, the asymptotic state of flavor conversions is qualitatively different from that in higher resolution models resolving all unstable modes of flavor instabilities. This is attributed to the fact that low spatial resolution models do not have abilities to erase ELN-XLN angular crossings which corresponds to a driving force of FFC. As a result, the angular resolution of neutrinos in low spatial resolutions becomes different from the highest resolution model. </li>

<li>They perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. They show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as $\sim 10^{51}$ erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Their results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, they predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. They find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</li>

<li><p>They perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over 100 ms post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). The focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. They derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Their results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, the mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, they observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, they also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that they cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The fate of the merger remnant depends primarily on the total mass and the EOS of NSs. Numerical simulations show that the remnant can either collapse directly into a black hole or form a massive NS. Observing GWs in either scenario can set an upper bound on the threshold mass for prompt collapse and reveals the matter dynamics of the massive NSs. Postmerger simulations of the latter case, spanning a few tens of milliseconds, show a spectrum dominated by a main peak at $\sim 2-4 \mathrm{kHz}$, with secondary peaks on either side.</p>
<p>Detailed mode analysis indicates that the main peak arises from the $m=2 f$-mode, while the secondary peaks may be attributed to the coupling between the $f$-mode and quasiradial $m=0$ mode, or spiral deformations when the massive NS mass is relatively below the collapse threshold. The correlation between the main $f$-mode and premerger global properties (such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability) can provide constraints on the EOS of NSs, particularly regarding phase transitions inside NSs. However, potential systematic uncertainties from gravitational theories and thermal effects must also be considered, and need further studies.</p>

<li>The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. They identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. They point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries’ merger time for $\mathcal{O}\left(1-10^4\right)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in “wet” SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</li>

<li><p>Measuring the neutrino flux of the next galactic CCSN with high statistics will reveal crucial information about the fundamental hydrodynamical processes involved in the explosion mechanism of the CCSN, which can manifest as fast-time features in the observed neutrino flux. Fast-time features in the flux are predicted to arise from hydrodynamical instabilities during the accretion phase or fast rotations of the progenitor, with model predictions varying greatly. IceCube and the planned large-scale extension IceCube-Gen 2 would cover a large parameter space of generic fast-time features, with IceCube-Gen 2 having greater sensitivity to fainter modulations and Galactic CCSNe at larger distances.</p>
<p>Wavelength-shifting technology has the potential to improve the sensitivity while constituting a comparatively inexpensive addition to the prospective sensor deployment. IceCube-Gen2, especially if equipped with wavelength shifters, will significantly enhance the detection of fast-time features throughout the Milky Way, allowing for $&gt;5 \sigma$ detection of modulations as low as $25 \%$ of the maximum flux, with the frequency and central time of these features reconstructable to within 7 Hz and 17 ms , respectively. The IceCube-Gen2 values demonstrate significant improvements to the detector’s sensitivity and reconstruction capabilities compared to IceCube.</p>

<li>Exploring the equation of state of dense matter is an essential part of interpreting the observable properties of neutron stars. They present here the first results for dense matter in the zero-temperature limit generated by the MUSES Calculation Engine, a composable workflow management system that orchestrates calculation and data processing stages comprising a collection of software modules designed within the MUSES framework. The modules presented in this work calculate equations of state using algorithms spanning three different theories/models: (1) Crust Density Functional Theory, valid starting at low densities, (2) Chiral Effective Field Theory, valid around saturation density, and (3) the Chiral Mean Field model, valid beyond saturation density. Lepton contributions are added through the Lepton module to each equation of state, ensuring charge neutrality and the possibility of $\beta$-equilibrium. They investigate the universality of equation of state-independent relations for our matched stars. Finally, for the first time, they use the Flavor Equilibration module to estimate bulk viscosity and flavor relaxation charge fraction and rates (at low temperature) for Chiral Effective Field Theory and the Chiral Mean Field model.</li>

<li><p>The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here they report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. They detect a muon with an estimated energy of $120_{-60}^{+110}$ petaelectronvolts ( PeV ). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.</p>

<li>Collapsars - massive stars whose cores promptly collapse into black holes (BHs) - can power long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) via relativistic, collimated, electromagnetically-driven outflows, or jets. Their power depends on the BH magnetic field strength and spin. To survive the infalling stellar material, jets need the central BH to attain dynamically important magnetic fields that can suppress the mass inflow and lead to a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Previous work found that non-radiative MADs can spin down their BHs to an equilibrium spin, $a<em>{\mathrm{eq}}^{\mathrm{nr}}=0.035-0.07$. Such low spins result in extremely low power jets that may struggle to escape out of the star. However, the dense and hot collapsar disks emit neutrinos that cool the disk, reduce its thickness, and increase the angular momentum supply to the BH . Using 3D two-moment neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, they show for the first time that successful collapsar jets powered by neutrino-cooled disks still rapidly spin down their BHs , although to a higher $a</em>{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 0.13$. This value is consistent with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA inferred spins, is $2-4 \mathrm{x}$ higher than for non-radiative MADs, and results in $4-16 x$ more powerful LGRB jets, which are more capable of drilling out of the progenitor star. This value of $a<em>{\text {eq }}$ holds across a wide range of progenitor structures and mass accretion rates, $\dot{m} \sim(0.1-10) M</em>{\odot} / \mathrm{s}$. We find that for typical LGRB durations, $t \gtrsim 30 \mathrm{~s}$, such BHs consume sufficient mass to reach $a_{\text {eq }} \approx 0.13$ by LGRB’s end. However, shorter or lower- $\dot{m}$ LGRBs can leave behind more rapidly spinning BHs.</li>

<li>In binary neutron star mergers, lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta and lanthanide-poor post-merger ejecta have been often linked to the red and blue kilonova emission, respectively. However, analytic light curve modeling of kilonova often results in the ejecta parameters that are at odds with such expectations. To investigate the physical meaning of the derived parameters, they perform analytic modeling of the kilonova light curves calculated with realistic multi-dimensional radiative transfer based on the numerical relativity simulations. Their fiducial simulations adopt a faster-moving, less massive dynamical ejecta and slower-moving, more massive post-merger ejecta. The results of analytic modeling, however, show that the inferred “red” component is more massive and slower, while the “blue” component is less massive and faster, as also inferred for GW170817/AT2017gfo. This suggests that the parameters derived from light curve modeling with an analytic model do not represent the true configuration of the kilonova ejecta. They demonstrate that the post-merger ejecta contributes to both blue and red emissions: the emission from the post-merger ejecta is absorbed and reprocessed to red emission by the dynamical ejecta with a higher lanthanide fraction. To derive the reliable total ejecta mass, multi-epoch observations in near-infrared wavelengths near their light curve peaks are important.</li>

</li>
<li><p>The main reason of this behavior is the reprocessing of photons from post-merger ejecta. In the mergers of a variety of neutron star masses, the post-merger ejecta tend to have a mass comparable to or higher than the dynamical ejecta, and thus, the post-merger ejecta serves as the significant heating source. A part of this emission from the post-merger ejecta is absorbed by the dynamical ejecta, which is mainly distributed in the equatorial plane. As a result, the photon is reprocessed to red emission, which is interpreted as the red component in the analytic light curve model. </p>
